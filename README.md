# Fixed_Income_Securities_and_Derivative_Modeling
Fixed Income Derivatives modeling is a triumph of Mathematical Finance, since all major institutions use the theory for pricing, hedging, and management risk, is by far the largest instrument class.

In this project, a LIBOR Market Model (LMM), also known as the BGM Model (Brace Gatarek Musiela Model), is established for forward rate dynamics modeling. Pricing formulas for options are derived based on Blackâ€™s formula. A Monte Carlo simulation framework is designed to generate the stochastic processes. Then a binomial tree and a trinomial tree are set up to numerically solve the system respectively. The model is calibrated to the U.S. market swaption volatilities.
